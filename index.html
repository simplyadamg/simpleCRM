<h2><a href="#two">FSBO #1</a> </h2>
	<p>Hello, I'm calling about the house/condo you have listed is it still available?<br>

My name is Adam Gordon. Are you cooperating with agents to get your home sold for more money?<br>

(yes no maybe continue)<br>

Can I ask your first name please? Great!<br>

The reason for my call... Is that when you are ready... To list your home... I want you to give us an interview okay?<br>

I'm curious, what is the advantage to you, to sell your own home?<br> 

Interesting... So you're thinking you'll cut out the middleman trying to sell the home yourself and pocket the difference, is that about it?<br>

Can I ask you a question?<br> 

What would the advantage be, for a qualified buyer, someone with good credit and plenty of cash , someone who is ready to buy soon... to find your home, out of the thousands available and to come up to your front door and buy your house/condo<br>

Well... Let's take your home for example you are selling it for <$450,000 > right? <br>

doesn't it make sense to you that a person who has reach a point in their life at which they can buy a home for $450,000 knows that they can walk into any real estate offince in the country and hire a buyer's agent FOR FREE?<br>

And look at all of the things that agent will do for them...<br>

<ul>
<li>- They will go through the thousands of home currently available;</li>
<li>- They will take them on a door to door tour of the best dozen or so homes</li>
<li>- They will negotiate to make the best deal for the buyer - not for you</li>
<li>- They will arrange the best financing package for them</li>
<li>- They will manage all the details of the entire transaction</li>
<li>- And they will probably buy them a closing gift too. All at no cost</li>
<ul>

So... As nice as your house/condo may be... what possible advantage does  QUALIFIED buyer have to purchase your home?

What I'm asking for is a sit down during which I will share our market research on the comps in your area, and show you how we can make you more money and sell your home faster. 

Is your calendar handy?


If they say they have a friend:

How long has your home been on the market? Well I recommend giving your call a friend soon because if your home has been on the market for more than 60 days you're doing something wrong. 


If they say they have an agent:

Great when are they planning on listing your property?

Can I follow up with you down the road and see where you're at, if you're not satisfied with the work they are doing perhaps we can be of service. 

Thanks!

If they ask for an email:

What would you like the email to contain?

Im in no rush:

	<p>Hello, thank you for taking my call. This is Adam Gordon with Buzzer Real Estate and I was curious...

When your house sells, where are you moving to?

Why

Frankly, I am calling as part of my commitment to proactively look for buyers for my sellers. 

Isn't that what you would want an agent to do for you? 

I mean if you hired an agent right? 

Else

Most agents do the 3 Ps of real estate. They place a sign in the yard, put the listing in the Multiple Listing Server and Pray someone else sells it. I, on the other hand do the 4th P, which is I proactively prospect to find buyers for my sellers. 

So I'll ask again, when your house sells, where are you moving to?

I am moving to...

Awesome,

How soon do you need to be there?

We plan to be in on  such date

Excellent

And so... You've got a house/condo for sale on a scale of  1-10 how motivated are you to sell it.

And out of curiosity, how did you determine the listing price for your house? 

Can I ask why you decided to sell your house yourself instead of listing with an agent? 

Are you familiar with what I do to get houses sold?

If I could show you a way that you could net more money by doing business with me would you do it?
